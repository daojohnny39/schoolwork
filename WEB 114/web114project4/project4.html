                <h1>Answer</h1>
                <p>
                    The reason why we are able to use alert(), confirm(), and prompt() without adding "window." is because
                    usually it is assumed that when using these functions, you are calling them from the window object. This can
                    be redefined and alert(), confirm(), and prompt() will not work the same after.

                <h1>Answer</h1>
                <p>
                    You can distinguish the difference of a JavaScript variable name from a string in JavaScript by looking at the syntax around.
                    Variables in JavaScript usually start with a lower-case letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign. For a string, it is usually
                    surrounded in quotes.
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        var myAge = 10; <i>// notice that "myAge" starts with a lowercase letter</i><br>
                        var myAge = "ten"; <i>// "ten" is surrounded in quotes</i>
                    </p>

                4.  Later, we'll gather our input from users in a more elegant way -- using &lt;input&gt; elements on a form.  We'll also output information 
                to users in a more elegant way -- by modifying existing or adding new elements and styles to the web page.  But for right now we are 
                using popup boxes created with the methods shown in #2.  What's the point of learning about these annoying popup boxes?

            <div class="question-within-question">
                <h1>Answer</h1>
                <p>
                    The point of learning these popup boxes is that it can help us in terms of debugging. As said in the summary of "Interaction: alert, prompt, 
                    confirm", these popups pause the script execution and don't allow the user to do anything until the popup has been interacted with. It also makes
                    learning the language a lot easier since these popup functions are limited in terms of customization.

            //step 3:
            let nameElement = document.querySelector('h1');
