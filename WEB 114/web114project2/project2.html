            <p>
                The DOM is the document object model. The document is the "entry point" that we use to access the different document object models within the page.
                The UI is the user interface. It is basically all the visual elements that the user sees when they visit a website. In JavaScript, for example, we
                can use a statement like "document.body.style.background = 'red';" to change the body element color of the website.

                The author recommends the DOM Living Standard specification.

            <h1>3.  Nodes are not super important to worry about at this point in your JavaScript career other than to be aware of them.  I really try to 
                break down and prioritize the important things you need to know in each javascript.info lesson in my YouTubes. So let's review some basic 
                JavaScript terminology as it relates to its connection with a web page.

                <div class="question-within-question">
                <p><b>3a. What is the document? And what is the document object?</b></p>
                <p>
                    As said earlier, The document is the entry point of the DOM. It is the root of the DOM tree. The document objects are the different objects within the
                    HTML file. An HTML file contains different elements. (title, head, body, etc.) These are the different objects within the HTML file. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p><b>3b. What operator do you use to access the methods and properties of an object?</b></p>
                <p>
                    To access the methods and properties of an object, you would use the dot operator. (.) For example, to access the body element of an HTML file,
                    you would write something like this:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>document.body.style.background = 'red';</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p><b>3c. What characters always follow a method?</b></p>
                <p>
                    Characters that always follow a method are parenthesis (). This looks like this:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>console.log("HEHEHEHEHE");</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p><b>3d. What, in general, does a method of an object do?</b></p>
                <p>
                    A method of an object is similar to a function within a class in any other language. I am familiar with C++ so I will use a C++ example.
                    An object is similar to a class in C++. Within that class, you may have functions that are associated with that specific class.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p><b>3e. What, in general, does a property of an object do?</b></p>
                <p>
                    A property of an object is similar to variables stored within a class. Another way we could see similarities is within SQL where you have
                    a table. You can make the comparison by imagining the different keys within the table as properties within an object.

            for (let i = 0; i < document.body.childNodes.length; i++) { // For loop that uses i as an index. As long as i is less than the amount of child nodes, it'll continue to run
                console.log( document.body.childNodes[i] ); // outputs the child nodes of the body element
            }
            for (let node of document.body.childNodes) { // add comment here
                console.log(node); // add comment here
