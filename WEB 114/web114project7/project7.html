                    One common JavaScript style guide that I found is <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">Google's JavaScript style guide</a>, 
                    which was listed in JavaScript.info: Coding Style.

                2. Identify three distinct "best practice" programming practices and explain how they create better code.
            </h1>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p>
                    The first one is using curly braces when writing functions, if statements, and loops.
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        if (n < 0)<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This kind of syntax can bring a lot of errors in the future when the writer decides to add more lines of code. Let's look
                    at the "correct" syntax for that statement:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        if (n < 0) &#123; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- opening bracket</i><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);<br>
                        &#125;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- closing bracket</i>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <p>
                    Another practice commonly used is splitting long lines of code or text into separate lines to improve readability.
                    Let's look at an example:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        let str = `
                            ECMA International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,
                            implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community
                            to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.<br>
                        `;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, it's pretty hard to distinguish the text from the code. Let's look at an example where the
                    text is split into separate lines:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        let str = `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- break line here</i><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECMA International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.<br>
                        `;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, that text was a lot easier to read as well as the code. This is a good practice to use when
                    there are long lines of text or code. (Especially on those if statements with multiple conditions)
