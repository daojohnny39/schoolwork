                    One common JavaScript style guide that I found is <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">Google's JavaScript style guide</a>, 
                    which was listed in <a href="https://javascript.info/coding-style#style-guides">JavaScript.info: Coding Style.</a>

                    The first one is using curly braces when writing functions, if statements, and loops.
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        if (n < 0)<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This kind of syntax can bring a lot of errors in the future when the writer decides to add more lines of code. Let's look
                    at the "correct" syntax for that statement:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        if (n < 0) &#123; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- opening bracket</i><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(`Power ${n} is not supported`);<br>
                        &#125;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- closing bracket</i>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Adding curly braces makes sure that the code will run accordingly to how the writer wants it to run. It also
                    makes it easier to distinguish the scope of the code whether it's a function, if statement, or loop.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <h1>Answer II</h1>
                <p>
                    Another practice commonly used is splitting long lines of code or text into separate lines to improve readability.
                    Let's look at an example:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        let str = `
                            ECMA International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,
                            implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community
                            to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.<br>
                        `;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, it's pretty hard to distinguish the text from the code. Let's look at an example where the
                    text is split into separate lines:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        let str = `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>// <-- break line here</i><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECMA International's TC39 is a group of JavaScript developers,<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementers, academics, and more, collaborating with the community<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript.<br>
                        `;
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, that text was a lot easier to read as well as the code. This is a good practice to use when
                    there are long lines of text or code. (Especially on those if statements with multiple conditions)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <h1>Answer III</h1>
                <p>
                    Another thing that is good practice is adding enough whitespace between lines of code. Let's look at an example:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        function pow(x, n) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let result = 1;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result *= x;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>
                        }
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This piece of code will run correctly. However, the issue comes when you are trying to debug the code or just reading
                    it in general. Let's look at another example where sufficient whitespace is added:
                </p>
                <div class="sample-code">
                    <p>
                        function pow(x, n) {<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let result = 1;<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result *= x;<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br><br>
                        }
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, the whitespace allows your eyes to distinguish the different parts within the code. This is good
                    general practice to implement in your code to allow other people to read it easier.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>4.  Explain the difference between a primitive, an array, and an object and include an example of each.</h1>

                    The differences between these 3 different types of data elements are pretty subtle but very obvious as well.
                    Once you see a little bit of code for each of those types of data elements, you'll be able to distinguish them
                    pretty easily. Let's look at an example of each:
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex;
                            justify-content: center;">
                    <div style="width: 80%;
                                border-style: solid; 
                                border-color: white; 
                                padding: 20px; 
                                border-radius: 10px;
                                background-color: rgb(79, 79, 79); 
                                box-shadow: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);">
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 0.9em;"><b>Primitive:</b></p>
                        <div class="sample-code">
                            <p>
                                let userName = "Johnny";<br>
                                let userAge = 21;<br>
                                let userGen = "male";
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Each of these variables are considered primitive data types. They are pretty easy to tell apart from the other
                            data types. It is also important to keep in mind that these primitive data types store only a single piece of data.
                            &lpar;Integers, strings, booleans, etc.&rpar;
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 0.9em;"><b>Arrays:</b></p>
                        <div class="sample-code">
                            <p>
                                
                            </p>
                        </div>
