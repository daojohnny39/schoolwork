                <h1>Answer</h1>
                <p>
                    To answer this, lets look at some sample code.<br><br>
                    This is a function declaration:
                </p>
                    <div class="sample-code">
                        <p>
                            function sortingHat() {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>do something...</i><br>
                            }
                        </p>
                    </div>
                <p>
                    This is a function expression:
                </p>
                    <div class="sample-code">
                        <p>
                            let sortingHat = function() {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>do something...</i><br>
                            }
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They may look like they do the same thing, which they do, but there is a key difference between these two. A function declaration could
                    be placed anywhere within the code and can be called anywhere within the code. A function expression can only be called AFTER it is ran.
                    This can help a lot with debugging.

                2. Why do we create functions in the first place? There are two big reasons. One has to do with when the statements in the functions run.
                The other has to do with how often the statements in a function are run.
            </h1>
            <div class="question-within-question">
                <h1>Answer</h1>
                <p>
                    For the first reason:<br><br>
                    We create functions so that it simplifies the code that we write. We can write multiple lines of code and execute it all at once
                    whenever we decide to call it. On the topic of simplicity, we can also put these functions in a different file so that the code is not 
                    so cluttered.<br><br>
                    For the second reason:<br><br>
                    Since we can write functions and execute multiple lines of statements whenever we decide to call it, that also means repetitive chunks
                    of statements could also be written inside a function and we can call it whenever we need to. This allows us to simplify the amount of code 
                    that we need to write.
