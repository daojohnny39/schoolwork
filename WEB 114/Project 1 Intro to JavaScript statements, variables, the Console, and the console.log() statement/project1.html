        <h2>Intro to JavaScript statements, variables, the Console, 
            and the console.log() statement</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What is the purpose of JavaScript?  
                Answer in general and also provide three specific examples 
                of how JavaScript is commonly used.</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Most websites use JavaScript for web page interactivity.</b> This could mean
                a variety of things such as instant user feedback, pop-up materials, and
                interative forms. These functionalities gives the illusion that the
                web page is "more alive".
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way that websites use JavaScript is to dynamically update web pages.
                Imagine a site like Amazon where the content is constantly being updated as
                the user scrolls. This function relies on JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>JavaScript can also be used for web application development. </b> JavaScript
                is the foundation of many different web frameworks like React and Angular. These
                different frameworks allows the developer to create a website that closely
                resembles an actual desktop application.
            </p>

        <div class="question">
            <h1>Who invented JavaScript and when?</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich back in 1995.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What software program will you be using to write JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>
                I will be using <b>VS Code</b> to write JavaScript because I like the interface of the
                file explorer. The way its displayed makes it easier for me to manage files.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What software program will you be using to run JavaScript?</h1>
            <p>
                I have always used Google Chrome as my main browser and will continue to do so unless
                there are functionalities that Chrome can't perform. In that case, I will be using
                Mozilla Firefox.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within an HTML file?</h1>
            <p>
                Having an external file for scripts makes big pages of code easier to look at.
                Having an external file can also help with reusability in the case that you
                want to reuse those same functionalities.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>AFTER DOING EXERCISE</h1>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What's the point of all of those console.log() statements?</h1>
            <p>
                These console.log statements were meant to help me see what the outputs are. This helped me
                understand the logic behind the different expressions. This can also help with debugging in the
                future as well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What's the difference between how you reference a variable versus a string in a JavaScript statement?</h1>
            <p>
                Generally, when you reference a string, you should use either "" or '' around the text. As for integers,
                you can leave them as is.
                
                <br><br>
                For example: 
                <br>
                let x = 5;
                <br>
                let x = "Hello";
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h1>What's the difference between a single value and an expression in a JavaScript statement?</h1>
            <p>
                When assigning a single value to a variable, there are no calculations done. When assigning
                an expression to a variable, there are calculations being done whether it be mathematical or
                just combining strings.

        /* PERSONAL NOTES:
            + operator treats all elements as strings when a string ("") is 
            first in the parameter.

            console.log will recognize integers even when stated with "" around as long
            as it is just a number inside. (ex. "4")
                - Same thing applies with * operator.

            using math operators (- * /) with a string and number will output an error.
                - console.log will not recognize that an integer is inside when there are
                  other characters as well. ("   -9   ")
                - as long as operator is not +, console.log will recognize integers even
                  if there are spaces in the parameter.

            null is treated as the number 0
